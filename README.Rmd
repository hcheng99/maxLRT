# package: nphSize

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Package: nphSize provides functions to perform combination test including maximum weighted logrank test (MWLR) and projection test, to calculate sample size with MWLR in a simulation-free approach allowing for staggered entry, drop-out etc, to visualize
the design parameters and to simulate survival data with flexible 
design input. 


## Installation

You can install the released version of nphSize from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
#install.packages("nphSize")
```
