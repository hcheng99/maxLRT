Description: Performs combination tests and sample size calculation for 
   fixed design with survival endpoints using combination tests under either
   proportional hazards or non-proportional hazards. The combination tests 
   include maximum weighted log-rank test and projection test. The sample 
   size calculation procedure is very flexible, allowing for user-defined
   hazard ratio function and considering various trial conditions like 
   staggered entry, drop-out etc. Trial simulation function is also provided 
   to facilitate the empirical power calculation.
