Description: performs combination tests and sample size calculation for 
   fixed design with survival endpoints using combination tests under either
   proportional hazards or nonproportional hazards. The combination tests 
   include maximum weighted logrank test and projection test. The sample 
   size calculation procedure is very flexibile, allowing for user-defined
   hazard ratio function and considering various trial conditions like 
   staggered enry, drop-out etc. Trial simulation function is also provided 
   to faciliate the empirical power calculation.
